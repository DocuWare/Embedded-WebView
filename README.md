# Embedded-WebView

## Introduction
With DocuWare 7.5 we have updated the browser runtime in our .NET applications to [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).  
This change also requires external developers to update their solutions when integrating parts of DocuWare WebClient into their .NET applications.

Using this example, you can see all the necessary changes for your application. Before you start, adjust the 'Source' setting in the application configuration file 'App.config' according to your needs.
